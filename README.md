# This is my first Expo app. 

I followed the youtube tutorial from https://youtu.be/BUXnASp_WyQ?si=z-jk0z7V8Zzav2UQ

I used an API for pokemons from this website, since I am practising the API catch and fetch.

I wanted the UI to look like this, so here is my inspo photo.

And this is my actual result,
